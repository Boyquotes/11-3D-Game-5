The game is no were need done and should have worked on it earlier just had other stuff to do, but so far there is a map and the player can walk around. There is xp but no way to obtain it inplemented yet only hitting "enter". Leveling up does change stats and the health bar does changed based on health of player at current level. The health can take damage but atm no way to take damage. Health is bugged as the base value doesnt change with level only the value that changes when damaged or healed.

#FIXED: HEALTH NOW CHANGES

all this is is a map with a mesh terr and grass were the player can walk around. Didn't add everything as planed
Health/XP/FPS/World/LVL
not added: way to earn xp-just needs a signal, take damage/deal damage-just needs signal
